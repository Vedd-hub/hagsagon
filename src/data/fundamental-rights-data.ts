    shortDescription: "Defines 'State' for Fundamental Rights, including government bodies and other authorities.",
    fullContent: `
      <p>This article defines the term "State" as it applies to Parts III (Fundamental Rights) and IV (Directive Principles). The definition is inclusive and covers:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>The Government and Parliament of India:</strong> The executive and legislative branches of the Union government.</li>
        <li><strong>The Government and Legislature of each State:</strong> The executive and legislative branches of the state governments.</li>
        <li><strong>All local authorities:</strong> Municipalities, Panchayats, District Boards, Improvement Trusts, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Other authorities:</strong> This is a broad term that courts have interpreted to include bodies that are created by the constitution or by law (statutory bodies like LIC, ONGC) and even non-statutory bodies that exercise public functions or are under significant state control.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4">The key test is whether a body is an agency or instrumentality of the government. This ensures that constitutional rights can be enforced against a wide range of public and quasi-public entities.</p>

      <p>This article lays down that the power to make laws, to give effect to certain specified fundamental rights, shall vest only in the Parliament and not in the state legislatures. This provision ensures that there is uniformity throughout India with regard to the nature of those fundamental rights and the punishment for their infringement.</p>
      <p class="mt-2">This includes making laws for prescribing residence as a condition for certain employments (Article 16), empowering courts to issue writs (Article 32), restricting the application of rights to armed forces (Article 33), and prescribing punishment for acts declared to be offences under the fundamental rights (like untouchability and forced labour).</p>
